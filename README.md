# Purpose

Allow a network of Filecoin Storage Providers (SP) to authenticate through cryptocurrency wallets (MetaMask and Coinbase) in order to vote on Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIP). This provides an interface to allow admin to create issues for voting and for all users to accurately view vote information. Vote information will display the amount of votes and voters, as well as the amount of storage space accounted for each position on the vote.
